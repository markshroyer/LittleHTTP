This is just a dead simple HTTP server; all it does is return a hardcoded
value for any HTTP request.  Not useful for anything at all except as a
pretense for screwing around with the Winsock API.

If you have Visual Studio or the Windows SDK installed, you can build the
program by running nmake within the source code directory.  A precompiled
x86 version is also available for download from the github project page.
