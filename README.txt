This is just a dead simple HTTP server; all it does is return a hardcoded
value for any HTTP request.  Not useful for anything at all except as a
pretense for screwing around with the Winsock API.

If you have Visual Studio or the Windows SDK installed, build the program
by running nmake within the source code directory.
